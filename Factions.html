<p class="whatis">What is Factions?:</p>
<p>For those of you that might not have heard of factions before, it is a team based survival type gamemode
where you can battle your friends or form alliances to take on other factions around the server map. Raid other
teams bases in order to gain their loot, or lock up and hold back the endless waves of attacks to be victorious.</p>
